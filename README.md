# Metis Project 5
### Ski Resort Recommender
Using Data that I web scraped from [skiresort.info](https://www.skiresort.info) I created a Web Application throuhg Streamlit to Recommend New Ski Resorts to users based on the user's previous favorite resort as well as additional optional features.

##### Objective
Help Skier's Explore new mountains adn terrain while still ensuring that they will enjoy the new mountains recommended to them.
