# Metis Project 5
### Ski Resort Recommender
Using Data that I web scraped from [skiresort.info](https://www.skiresort.info) I created a Web Application through Streamlit to recommend new Ski Resorts to users based on the user's previous favorite resort as well as additional optional features.

#### Objective
Help Skier's Explore new mountains and terrain while still ensuring that they will enjoy the skiing experience.

#### Code
The code for this project can be found on my github.  [This](https://github.com/lucy-allen/Project_5/tree/master/Web_Scraping) is the folder containing my web scraping and data cleaning code and [here](https://github.com/lucy-allen/Project_5/tree/master/Streamlit_App) is the folder containing the code for my streamlit app.
